In order to find jodakshar we need to join all the _mulkasharas_ with themselves.
Therefore the following table was created.

{{{
drop table if exists mulakshare;

CREATE TABLE `mulakshare` (
  `akshar` varchar(100) default NULL,
   primary key (akshar) 
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('क्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ख्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ग्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('घ्');

INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('च्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('छ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ज्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('झ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ञ्');


INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ट्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ठ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ड्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ढ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ण्');

INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('त्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('थ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('द्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ध्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('न्');

INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('प्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('फ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ब्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('भ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('म्');

INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('य्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('र्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ल्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('व्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('श्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ष्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('स्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ह्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('ळ्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('क्श्');
INSERT INTO `mulakshare` (`akshar`) VALUES('द्न्य्');

}}}

The following query will generate all the possible jodakshars.

select concat(a.akshar, b.akshar) as jodakshar from mulakshare as a inner join mulakshare as b

{{{

}}}

In the extract shown above, the character "क्" is joined with all other mulakshars. There are 35 mulkashars and therefore the number of possible combination is 1,225. Now we need to find if these jodakshars were used anywhere in the database and if it was used what was the character just before the "jodakshar". The following query was used:

{{{
select * from wordbase as a inner join 
(select concat(a.akshar, b.akshar) as jodakshar from mulakshare as a inner join mulakshare as b) as dt
where word like concat('%', jodakshar , '%')   limit 10

}}}



In order to locate the exact position of the "jodakshar" we need to use the locate function. Let's dissect the word 'व्युत्क्रम' and find out the position number of each character.

{{{
SELECT substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -10, 1 ) AS one, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -9, 1 ) AS two, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -8, 1 ) AS three, 
substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -7, 1 ) AS four, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -6, 1 ) AS five, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -5, 1 ) AS six, 
substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -4, 1 ) AS seven, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -3, 1 ) AS eight, substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -2, 1 ) AS nine, 
substring( 'व्युत्क्रम', -1, 1 ) AS ten 


one 	two 	three 	four 	five 	six 	seven 	eight 	nine 	ten
व 	् 	य 	ु 	त 	् 	क 	् 	र 	म


select locate('त्क्' , 'व्युत्क्रम')
5

select substring('व्युत्क्रम', (locate('त्क्' , 'व्युत्क्रम')*1))
त्क्रम
